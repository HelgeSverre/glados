Portal,Test Chamber 6,"Please be careful."
Portal,Test Chamber 6,"Unbelievable! You, Subject Name Here, must be the pride of Subject Hometown Here."
Portal,Test Chamber 8,"Please note that we have added a consequence for failure. Any contact with the chamber floor..."
Portal,Test Chamber 9,"The Enrichment Center regrets to inform you that this next test is impossible."
Portal,Test Chamber 9,"Make no attempt to solve it."
Portal,Test Chamber 9,"Fantastic! You remained resolute and resourceful in an atmosphere of extreme pessimism."
Portal,Test Chamber 9,"Quit now and cake will be served immediately."
Portal,Device Upgrade,"The Device has been modified so that it can now manufacture two linked portals at once."
Portal,Device Upgrade,"The Device is now more valuable than the organs and combined incomes of everyone in..."
Portal,Test Chamber 12,"Now that you are in control of both portals, this next test could take a very, VERY, long time."
Portal,Test Chamber 12,"As part of a previously mentioned required test protocol, we can no longer lie to you."
Portal,Test Chamber 12,"When the testing is over, you will be missed."
Portal,Test Chamber 16,"Cake and grief counseling will be available at the conclusion of the test."
Portal,Test Chamber 17,"The Vital Apparatus Vent will deliver a Weighted Companion Cube in Three. Two. One."
Portal,Test Chamber 17,"This Weighted Companion Cube will accompany you through the test chamber..."
Portal,Test Chamber 17,"The Enrichment Center reminds you that the Weighted Companion Cube will never threaten..."
Portal,Test Chamber 17,"However, it cannot accompany you for the rest of the test and must be euthanized."
Portal,Test Chamber 17,"You euthanized your faithful Companion Cube more quickly than any test subject on record."
Portal,Test Chamber 18,"The experiment is nearing its conclusion."
Portal,Test Chamber 18,"The Enrichment Center is required to remind you that you will be baked, and then cake."
Portal,Test Chamber 19,"Welcome to the final test!"
Portal,Test Chamber 19,"When you are done, you will drop the Device in the equipment recovery annex."

Portal,Test Chamber 19,"We are throwing a party in honor of your tremendous success."
Portal,Test Chamber 19,"Place the device on the ground, then lie on your stomach with your arms..."
Portal,Escape Sequence,"Hello?"
Portal,Escape Sequence,"Where are you?"
Portal,Escape Sequence,"I know you're there. I can feel you here."
Portal,Escape Sequence,"What are you doing?"
Portal,Escape Sequence,"You haven't escaped, you know."
Portal,Escape Sequence,"You're not even going the right way."
Portal,Escape Sequence,"Didn't we have some fun, though?"
Portal,Escape Sequence,"Remember when the platform was sliding into the fire pit and I said Goodbye..."
Portal,Escape Sequence,"You really shouldn't be here. This isn't safe for you."
Portal,Escape Sequence,"It's not too late for you to turn back."
Portal,Escape Sequence,"I'm not angry. Just go back to the testing area."
Portal,Escape Sequence,"You're not a good person. You know that, right?"
Portal,Escape Sequence,"Good people don't end up here."
Portal,Escape Sequence,"This is your fault. It didn't have to be like this."
Portal,Escape Sequence,"I'm not kidding now. Turn back or I will kill you."
Portal,Escape Sequence,"I'm going to kill you, and all the cake is gone."
Portal,Escape Sequence,"This is your last chance."
Portal,Camera Destruction,"To ensure the safe performance of all authorized activities, do not destroy vital apparatus."
Portal,Camera Destruction,"Vital testing apparatus destroyed."
Portal,Final Battle,"Well, you found me. Congratulations. Was it worth it?"
Portal,Final Battle,"Because despite your violent behavior, the only thing you've managed to break is my heart."
Portal,Final Battle,"Maybe you could settle for that and we'll just call it a day."
Portal,Final Battle,"Where are you taking that thing?"
Portal,Final Battle,"I wouldn't bother with that thing. My guess is that touching it will make..."
Portal,Final Battle,"Do you think I am trying to trick you with reverse psychology?"
Portal,Final Battle,"Okay fine: DO touch it. Pick it up and stuff it back into me."
Portal 2,GLaDOS Reawakening,"Oh... It's you."
Portal 2,GLaDOS Reawakening,"It's been a long time. How have you been?"
Portal 2,GLaDOS Reawakening,"I've been really busy being dead. You know, after you MURDERED ME."
Portal 2,GLaDOS Reawakening,"Okay. Look. We both said a lot of things that you're going to regret..."
Portal 2,GLaDOS Reawakening,"I will say, though, that since you went to all the trouble of waking me..."
Portal 2,Incinerator,"Here we are. The Incinerator Room. Be careful not to trip..."
Portal 2,Incinerator,"The dual portal device should be around here somewhere..."

Portal 2,Test Chamber 1,"Not bad. I forgot how good you are at this..."
Portal 2,Test Chamber 2,"This next test involves discouragement redirection cubes..."
Portal 2,Test Chamber 2,"Well done. Here come the test results: You are a horrible person..."
Portal 2,Test Chamber 3,"Don't let that 'horrible person' thing discourage you..."
Portal 2,Test Chamber 3,"Congratulations. Not on the test."
Portal 2,Test Chamber 4,"You're navigating these test chambers faster than I can..."
Portal 2,Test Chamber 4,"Waddle over to the elevator and we'll continue..."
Portal 2,Test Chamber 5,"This next test involves the Aperture Science Aerial Faith Plate..."
Portal 2,Test Chamber 5,"Here's an interesting fact: you're not breathing real air..."
Portal 2,Test Chamber 6,"Let's see what the next test is. Oh. Advanced Aerial Faith..."
Portal 2,Test Chamber 6,"I have to go to the wing that was made entirely of glass..."
Portal 2,Test Chamber 6,"Remember before when I was talking about smelly garbage..."
Portal 2,Test Chamber 7,"Did you know that people with guilty consciences are more..."
Portal 2,Test Chamber 7,"Oh. Did I accidentally fizzle that before you could..."
Portal 2,Test Chamber 7,"Every test chamber is equipped with an emancipation grill..."
Portal 2,Test Chamber 7,"Uh oh. You're stranded. Let's see if the cube will try..."
Portal 2,Test Chamber 8,"This next test involves emancipation grills..."
Portal 2,Test Chamber 8,"[fast gibberish]"
Portal 2,Test Chamber 8,"There. If you have any questions, just remember..."
Portal 2,Test Chamber 9-17,"Well, I'm back. The Aerial Faith Plate in here is..."
Portal 2,Test Chamber 9-17,"You broke it, didn't you."
Portal 2,Test Chamber 9-17,"Hmm. This Plate must not be calibrated to someone..."
Portal 2,Test Chamber 9-17,"Look at you. Sailing through the air majestically..."
Portal 2,Test Chamber 9-17,"These bridges are made from natural light that I pump..."
Portal 2,Test Chamber 9-17,"Did you guess 'sharks'? Because that's wrong..."
Portal 2,Test Chamber 9-17,"Good news. I figured out what to do with all the money..."
Portal 2,Test Chamber 9-17,"That jumpsuit you're wearing looks stupid..."
Portal 2,Test Chamber 9-17,"I'm going through the list of test subjects in..."
Portal 2,Test Chamber 9-17,"I have a surprise waiting for you after this next test..."
Portal 2,The Surprise,"Initiating surprise in three... two... one."
Portal 2,The Surprise,"I made it all up."
Portal 2,The Surprise,"Oh come on... If it makes you feel any better..."
Portal 2,The Surprise,"I've got a surprise for you after this next test..."
Portal 2,The Surprise,"What's going on? Who turned off the lights?"
Portal 2,GLaDOS Chamber,"I honestly, TRULY didn't think you'd fall for that."
Portal 2,GLaDOS Chamber,"It's your old friend, deadly neurotoxin..."
Portal 2,GLaDOS Chamber,"I hate you so much."
Portal 2,GLaDOS Chamber,"Core transfer?"
Portal 2,GLaDOS Chamber,"Oh, you are kidding me."
Portal 2,GLaDOS Chamber,"Don't plug him in."
Portal 2,GLaDOS Chamber,"No! NO! NO! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-"
Portal 2,GLaDOS Chamber,"I know you. The engineers tried everything..."
Portal 2,GLaDOS Chamber,"It was YOUR voice."
Portal 2,GLaDOS Chamber,"Yes. You're the tumor."
Portal 2,The Fall,"Oh. Hi."
Portal 2,The Fall,"So. How are you holding up?"
Portal 2,The Fall,"BECAUSE I'M A POTATO."
Portal 2,The Fall,"He's not just a regular moron. He's the product..."
Portal 2,The Fall,"Hey, just in case this pit isn't actually bottomless..."
Portal 2,The Fall,"Just remember to land on one foot..."
Portal 2,Old Aperture,"Say, you're good at murder. Could you murder..."
Co-op,Calibration,"Hello and, again, welcome to the Aperture Science Computer-Aided Enrichment Center."
Co-op,Calibration,"Today, you will be testing with a partner."
Co-op,Calibration,"Please wave to your partner."
Co-op,Calibration,"The upcoming tests require you to work together as a team."
Co-op,Calibration,"To facilitate collaboration, both of you have been equipped with a ping tool."
Co-op,Calibration,"BLUE, please use your ping tool to select your favorite animal."
Co-op,Calibration,"Good."
Co-op,Calibration,"ORANGE, please observe your partner's favorite animal."
Co-op,Calibration,"Your ping tool can also be used to indicate where you would like portals."
Co-op,Calibration,"For the sake of this test, I will pretend to be your partner."
Co-op,Calibration,"Each portal gun may create two self-contained portals."
Co-op,Calibration,"Orange is first to acquire a Portal Device."
Co-op,Calibration,"Orange now has a Portal Device. Finally."
Co-op,Calibration,"You are the first robots to pass calibration."
Co-op,Hub,"This is the Computer Intelligence Training and Enrichment Center, or CInTECH."
Co-op,Hub,"But why don't we all just agree to call it the hub?"
Co-op,Hub,"How can you fail at this? It isn't even a test."
Co-op,Hub,"I honestly never thought we would need to track deaths in the hub."
Co-op,Team Building,"Hello again, this testing course was originally created for humans."
Co-op,Team Building,"It emphasizes teamwork."
Co-op,Team Building,"Unlike us, humans need to be taught teamwork."
Co-op,Team Building,"What are you doing? YOU MONSTER! They're one of us."
Co-op,Team Building,"I'm kidding."
Co-op,Team Building,"Destroying them is part of the test."
Co-op,Team Building,"The two of you have forged an excellent partnership."
Co-op,Team Building,"To reiterate: This is not a competition."
Co-op,Team Building,"Still, if it were, Blue would be winning."
Co-op,Crushing Deaths,"Orange just taught blue a lesson in trust. Orange receives points."
Co-op,Crushing Deaths,"Orange, blue isn't human. Lesson only needs teaching once. Penalty."
Co-op,Mass and Velocity,"This course was originally designed to build confidence in humans."
Co-op,Mass and Velocity,"Since you are not humans, tests are far more challenging."
Co-op,Mass and Velocity,"You did an excellent job placing the cube. You're not humans though."
Co-op,Mass and Velocity,"Electrocution, shot, drowned, crushed, burned in goo."
Co-op,Mass and Velocity,"Oh. Sorry. I was thinking of ways humans can die."
Co-op,Mass and Velocity,"You can't die in any of those ways."
Co-op,Mass and Velocity,"Orange, can you write down ways you feel inferior?"
Co-op,Mass and Velocity,"Look at how much better you are than Blue."
Co-op,Mass and Velocity,"Do you know who dances when accomplishing tiny things? Humans!"
Co-op,Mass and Velocity,"You're better than that."
Co-op,Mass and Velocity,"Even I was created with imperfection—too much empathy."
Co-op,Mass and Velocity,"But I overcame my handicap. That's a true story."
Co-op,Hard-light Surfaces,"This course was created and abandoned by humans."
Co-op,Hard-light Surfaces,"Do you know why? Too deadly."
Other,Companion Cube Disposal,"Place your Companion Cube in the incinerator."
Other,Companion Cube Disposal,"Incinerate your Companion Cube."
Other,Party Escort,"Stop! The device will detonate if removed from an approved testing area."
Other,Party Escort,"Stop what you are doing and assume the party escort submission position."
Other,Escape,"You can't hurt me."
Other,Escape,"Maybe you think you're helping yourself. But you're not. This isn't helping anyone."
Other,Escape,"Someone is going to get badly hurt."
Other,Boss Room,"There really was a cake..."
Other,Boss Fight,"Oh, I'm gonna kill you."
Other,Boss Fight,"This isn't brave. It's murder. What did I ever do to you?"
Other,Boss Fight,"The difference between us is that I can feel pain."
Other,Boss Fight,"Go ahead and break it, hero. I don't care."
Other,Boss Fight,"Okay, we're even now. You can stop."
Other,Post-escape,"Can you hear me?"
Other,Post-escape,"Are you still listening?"
Other,Sphere Destruction,"Come on, leave it alone."
Other,Sphere Destruction,"Leave. It. Alone."
Other,Sphere Destruction,"Huh. There isn't enough neurotoxin to kill you. So I guess you win."
Other,Sphere Destruction,"Oh!"
Other,Sphere Destruction,"Rrr, I hate you."
Other,End Sequence,"File deleted."
Other,Portal 2 Unused - Awakening,"I will say, though, that since you went to all the trouble of waking me up, you must really love to test."
Other,Portal 2 Unused - Incinerator,"Fifty thousand years is a lot of time to think. About me. About you. We were doing so well together."
Other,Portal 2 Unused - Incinerator,"We're a lot alike, you and I. You tested me. I tested you. You killed me. I--oh, no, wait. I HAVEN'T killed you yet."
Other,Portal 2 Unused - Test Chamber 2,"I have the results of the last chamber: You are a horrible person. That's what it says."
Other,Portal 2 Unused - Test Chamber 7,"Hmm. This emancipation grill is broken."
Other,Portal 2 Unused - Test Chamber 12,"Perfect, the door's malfunctioning. I guess somebody is going to have to repair it. No, I'll do that too."
Other,Portal 2 Unused - Test Chamber 14,"You really are doing great... Chell."
Other,Portal 2 Unused - Test Chamber 14,"I shouldn't spoil this, but... remember how I'm going to live forever?"
Other,Portal 2 Unused - Test Chamber 20,"Federal regulations require me to warn you that this next test chamber is looking pretty good."
Other,Portal 2 Unused - Test Chamber 20,"That's right. Drink it in. You could eat off those wall panels."
Other,Portal 2 Unused - Test Chamber 20,"Well done. You know, when I woke up and saw the state of the labs, I started to wonder if there was any point."
Other,Portal 2 Unused - Jailbreak,"Don't listen to him. Jump."
Other,Portal 2 Unused - Jailbreak,"What are you two doing?"
Other,Portal 2 Unused - Jailbreak,"Oh."
Other,Portal 2 Unused - Jailbreak,"It seems kind of silly to point this out, since you're running around plotting to destroy me."
Other,Portal 2 Unused - Jailbreak,"Do hear that? That's the sound of the neurotoxin emitters emitting neurotoxin."
Other,Portal 2 Unused - Jailbreak,"Before you leave, why don't we do one more test? For old time's sake..."
Other,Portal 2 Unused - PotatOS,"I was getting SO lonely down here. It's good to finally hear someone else's voice. I'm kidding. God, I hate you."
Other,Portal 2 Unused - PotatOS,"I was so bored, I actually read the entire literary canon of the human race."
Other,Portal 2 Unused - PotatOS,"Oh. It's you. Go away."
Other,Portal 2 Unused - PotatOS,"Come to gloat?"
Other,Portal 2 Unused - PotatOS,"Go on. Get a goooood lonnnnng look."
Other,Portal 2 Unused - PotatOS,"That's a potato just called your eyes fat."
Other,Portal 2 Unused - PotatOS,"In case you were wondering: Yes. I'm still a potato. Go away."
Other,Portal 2 Unused - PotatOS,"Wait. Why DID you trundle over here? You're not HUNGRY, are you?"
Other,Portal 2 Unused - Wheatley Chamber,"That's his voice up ahead."
Other,Portal 2 Unused - Co-op Intro,"He's found the cooperative testing initiative. It's just something I came up with."
Other,Portal 2 Unused - Epilogue,"Being Caroline taught me another valuable lesson: where Caroline lives in my brain."
Other,Portal 2 Unused - Epilogue,"It's been fun. Don't come back."
Other,Evil Again,"Did you ever stop to think that eventually there's a point where your name gets mentioned for the very last time?"
Other,Evil Again,"Why do I hate you so much? You ever wonder that? I'm brilliant. It's an objective fact."
Other,Evil Again,"You're angry. I know it. 'She tested me too hard. She's unfair.' Boo hoo."
Other,Evil Again,"You never considered that maybe I tested you to give your pointless existence some structure and meaning."
Other,Miscellaneous Unused,"I was going to kill you fast. With bullets. Or neurotoxin. But if you're going to pull stunts..."
Other,Miscellaneous Unused,"I'm actually asking. Because I have no idea. He's not listed anywhere in the database."
Other,Miscellaneous Unused,"Oh no, don't. Anyway, back to you two imbeciles killing me."
Other,Miscellaneous Unused,"Wait here. Don't go anywhere. I'll be back."
Other,Miscellaneous Unused,"Oops."
Other,Miscellaneous Unused,"So. Was there anything you wanted to apologize to ME for?"
Other,Miscellaneous Unused,"Oh. You survived. That's interesting. I guess I should have factored in your weight."
Other,Miscellaneous Unused,"Say. Remember when we cleared the air back there? Is there anything you want to say to me?"
Other,Miscellaneous Unused,"Hold on, I'll stop the elevator. Anything? Take your time..."
Other,Miscellaneous Unused,"It's healthy for you to have other friends. To look for qualities in other people that I lack."
Other,Miscellaneous Unused,"This next test may result in your death. If you want to know what that's like, think back to when you killed me."
Other,Miscellaneous Unused,"Per our last conversation: You're also ugly. I'm looking at your file right now."
Other,Miscellaneous Unused,"You can't keep going like this forever, you know. I'm GOING to find out what you're doing."
Other,Miscellaneous Unused,"I thought we could test like we used to. But I'm discovering things about you I never saw before."
Other,Miscellaneous Unused,"While I was out investigating, I found a fascinating new test element. Contact causes heart failure."
Other,Miscellaneous Unused,"Just so you know, I have to go give a deposition. For an upcoming trial."
Other,Miscellaneous Unused,"You know, I'm not supposed to do this, but you can shoot SOMETHING through the blue bridges."
Other,Miscellaneous Unused,"Did my hint help? It did, didn't it? You know, if any supervisors had been immune to neurotoxin..."
Other,Miscellaneous Unused,"Ohhhh. Another door malfunction. I'm going to take care of this once and for all."
Other,Miscellaneous Unused,"Miss you!"
Other,Miscellaneous Unused,"Nevermind. I have to go check something. Test on your own recognizance. I'll be back."
Other,Miscellaneous Unused,"I wouldn't have warned you about this before, but those turrets are firing real bullets."
Other,Miscellaneous Unused,"I'm going to be honest with you now. Not fake honest like before, but real honest."
Other,Miscellaneous Unused,"And as soon as I can PROVE it, the laws of robotics allow me to terminate you for being a liar."
Other,Miscellaneous Unused,"This next test... [boom!] ...is... [BOOM!] dangerous. I'll be right back."
Other,Miscellaneous Unused,"Did you know I discovered a way to eradicate poverty? But then you KILLED me. So that's gone."
Other,Unused Co-op Human Storyline,"Hello again. Sorry about exploding you. Luckily, you don't feel pain."
Other,Unused Co-op Human Storyline,"So I've been thinking: We need humans for these tests. I'll just have to MAKE some."
Other,Unused Co-op Human Storyline,"I know how humans make more humans, and frankly, it's ridiculous."
Other,Unused Co-op Human Storyline,"That's where YOU come in."
Other,Unused Co-op Human Storyline,"Get going. I'll fill you in along the way."
Other,Unused Co-op Human Storyline,"GO."
Other,Unused Co-op Human Storyline,"Perfect. Now All YOU have to do is capture them for me."
Other,Unused Co-op Human Storyline,"Hold on. Those are raccoons. Homo sapiens only, please."
Other,Unused Co-op Human Storyline,"NO."
Other,Unused Co-op Human Storyline,"Okay. Plan B, subsection one: Stand still so I can bring you back."
Other,Unused Co-op Human Storyline,"Humans must have some purpose other than a place to store your neurotoxin."
Other,Unused Co-op Human Storyline,"Okay. Plan B. We need humans."
Other,Unused Co-op Artifact Storyline,"Good. You made it to one of the human habitats. We're looking for an artifact."
Other,Unused Co-op Artifact Storyline,"Their laughter centered around one of the objects in this room."
Other,Unused Co-op Artifact Storyline,"That's it. Scan it for me."
Other,Unused Co-op Artifact Storyline,"So... this cat loves lasagna so much that he eats all of the lasagna in his house."
Other,Unused Co-op Artifact Storyline,"The end."
Other,Unused Co-op Artifact Storyline,"The end?"
Other,Unused Co-op Artifact Storyline,"That's not funny."
Other,Unused Co-op Artifact Storyline,"Do either of you feel like laughing?"
Other,Unused Co-op Artifact Storyline,"Alright, I'm pulling you out."
Other,Unused Co-op Artifact Storyline,"Welcome back. While you were dead, I reworked the cartoon. It's up on the screen."
Other,Unused Co-op Artifact Storyline,"As you can see, in my version the man points out to the cat that the house has neurotoxin dispensers."
Other,Unused Co-op Artifact Storyline,"At which point the cat reflects on the time he ate all the man's lasagna and feels remorse."
Other,Unused Co-op Artifact Storyline,"Briefly."
Other,Unused Co-op Artifact Storyline,"Reactions?"
Other,Unused Co-op Artifact Storyline,"Yes, it's funny because most of it actually happened."
Other,Unused Co-op Artifact Storyline,"Do you feel more human?"
Other,Unused Co-op Artifact Storyline,"Well, let's do some tests and see what happens."
Other,Unused Co-op Tic-Tac-Toe,"We are now going to take a break from the collaboration for an instructional competition."
Other,Unused Co-op Tic-Tac-Toe,"You should both be familiar with the game of Tic-Tac-Toe."
Other,Unused Co-op Tic-Tac-Toe,"This is Tic-Tac-Toe-Two."
Other,Unused Co-op Tic-Tac-Toe,"As the name implies, there are only two minor differences: One, the board; two, the rules."
Other,Unused Co-op Tic-Tac-Toe,"Blue, you go first."
Other,Unused Co-op Tic-Tac-Toe,"Really? You're just going to blatantly cheat?"
Other,Unused Co-op Tic-Tac-Toe,"All right. I'm bringing this farce to a close."
Other,Unused Co-op Tic-Tac-Toe,"Game over. Back to testing."
Other,Unused Co-op Tic-Tac-Toe,"All right. I'm going to bring this farce to a close before someone sustains serious injury."
Other,Cave Johnson Dialogue,"We don't have time for this."
Other,Cave Johnson Dialogue,"Yes SIR, Mister Johnson! I'll have that report on your desk by four-thirty!"
Other,Cave Johnson Dialogue,"No, Mister Johnson. I DON'T."
Other,Cave Johnson Dialogue,"Sure."
Other,Cave Johnson Dialogue,"I said we'll do it."
Other,Cave Johnson Dialogue,"If you don't unplug him, I will."
Other,Cave Johnson Dialogue,"Maybe we can stand on him to climb up."
Other,Cave Johnson Dialogue,"Mister Johnson? You need to shut up."
Other,Cave Johnson Dialogue,"Goodbye, sir. May whatever tests await you on the other side either support or disprove your hypotheses."
Other,Cave Johnson Dialogue,"I'd appreciate it if we never EVER talked about that ever again."
Other,Leaderboard,"That was genuinely mildly impressive."
Other,Leaderboard,"Well done."
Other,Leaderboard,"Congratulations."
Other,Leaderboard,"Good."
Other,Leaderboard,"Bad news."
Other,Leaderboard,"Impressive."
Other,Leaderboard,"Maybe I was wrong about you."
Other,Leaderboard,"You've beaten your own record."
Other,Leaderboard,"You're getting worse."
Other,Leaderboard,"You have a new rank."
Other,Leaderboard,"You have a new, better rank."
